## 💡 Practical Application Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Conservative (99th Percentile)
```
Approach: Only predict on extremely confident games
Games/Season: 26 games (1.1%)
Expected Correct: 15 games (57.7%)
Expected Incorrect: 11 games (42.3%)

Use for: High-stakes betting, maximum confidence
Risk: Very limited opportunities
```

### Scenario 2: Balanced (90th Percentile)
```
Approach: Use only high-confidence predictions
Games/Season: 253 games (10.2%)
Expected Correct: 143 games (56.5%)
Expected Incorrect: 110 games (43.5%)

Use for: Daily sports betting, prediction services
Risk: Moderate, good balance of frequency and accuracy
```

### Scenario 3: Aggressive (50th Percentile)
```
Approach: Use all predictions above median confidence
Games/Season: 1,236 games (50%)
Expected Correct: 696 games (56.3%)
Expected Incorrect: 540 games (43.7%)

Use for: Daily predictions, public recommendations
Risk: Higher volume, slightly better than baseline
```

### Scenario 4: Hybrid (Mixed)
```
Approach: Use confidence-weighted portfolio
- 99th percentile (1% weight): 57.7% × 1% = 0.6%
- 90th percentile (5% weight): 56.5% × 5% = 2.8%
- 50th percentile (94% weight): 56.3% × 94% = 52.9%

Blended accuracy: ~56.3% overall
Better than baseline, diversified risk
