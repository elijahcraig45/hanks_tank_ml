    "- ✅ Star schema design (fact + dimension tables)\n",
    "- ✅ Normalization vs denormalization tradeoffs\n",
    "- ✅ Creating denormalized ML feature tables\n",
    "- ✅ Performance benefits of denormalization\n",
    "- ✅ Designing schemas for specific ML tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "1. **Normalize for storage**, denormalize for ML queries\n",
    "2. **Star schema** is ideal for BigQuery analytics\n",
    "3. **Denormalized feature tables** are 10-100x faster\n",
    "4. **Partition and cluster** feature tables for best performance\n",
    "5. **Window functions** in feature creation enable powerful rolling stats\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Create the dimension and fact tables for your data\n",
    "2. Build your first denormalized ML feature table\n",
    "3. Benchmark query performance improvements\n",
    "4. Design feature tables for your specific ML use cases\n",
