    "\n",
    "**Project:** Hank's Tank MLB Data Platform  \n",
    "**Component:** Data Collection Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a proof-of-concept for the automated data collection system defined in `docs/DATA_COLLECTION_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`. \n",
    "We will validate the specific API endpoints, parameters, and response structures required to build our historical database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "1. Verify connectivity to MLB Stats API and Baseball Savant.\n",
    "2. Validate that critical parameters (like `qualified=false`) return the expected data volume.\n",
    "3. Inspect JSON response structures to ensure our schema mapping is correct.\n",
    "4. Test data availability for a sample date in the 2025 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Date:** May 15, 2025 (Selected as a typical regular season day with a full slate of games)"
